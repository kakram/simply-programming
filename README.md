# simply-programming
Code for programming tutorials. Languages, algorithms, data structures. Beginner, improvers and advanced.

Simple examples on my YouTube channel (Simply Programming):

- for people wanting to get into coding.

No frills short and to the point videos without distracting music, waffle and irritating effects - 
just the code and basic explanation as I write it out.

This repo contains the code from the videos for those people who don't want to type it in and just want to
clone and start tinkering immediately.

Enjoy
